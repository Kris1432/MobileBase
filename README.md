About
=====

Mobile Base (MB), is all about allowing you to take apart of your base along with you on your travels around the Minecraft world. It is centred around tents, essentially allowing you to place down a tent which is a 8x8 structure.

Once down you can place blocks down of all sorts, chests, furnaces, beds, hoppers and redstone circuits. The second you break any part of the tent, the tent will fall down and spawn an Item version of the tent, which will save all it's content, which will be ready for you when you next need it and place it down.
