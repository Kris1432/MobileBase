About
=====

This mod is about allowing you to take a part of your base with you, in the form of a tent. Simply craft a tent, place it
down. Tt will create a 9x9 (or simillar) structure, anything you place in this tent will be remebered when you pick it back
up in tent form. This is achived by simply knocking out the centre pole of the tent, which will spawn an item. The next time
you want to pitch up your tent, just place it down and you have a safe heaven.
